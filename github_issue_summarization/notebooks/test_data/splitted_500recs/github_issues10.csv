_originally opened as https://github.com/compevol/beast2/issues/598_ ---- for experimentation with a stochastic dollo model, i have generated an alignment with a mutationdeathtype containing all my data, and a filteredalignment taking a subset of its columns. the filteredalignment tries to convert the sequences of the original alignment , and there are two problems with this.
1. the filteredalignment attempts a conversion even when it shares a data type with the alignment , which should not be necessary.
2. the filteredalignment uses some obscure and obviously wrong method to do the conversion. the first one just makes the setup a bit slower, which should not matter. but the fact that filteredalignment calls datatype.getchar int state is a bug, because there should be a better way to do this translation. beyond that, the existence of datatype.getchar is quite crazy, because it assumes that every int state maps to a single char – and, independent of the codemap input, according to 0→a, 1→b etc. this looks like a very erroneous assumption the effects can be seen in this bug , so i would be very much in favour of deprecating that function and replacing its use, with a sensible implementation of getcode or maybe something else."
