brightpearlsalesorderrowrepository after doing some research about this scenareo, it seems the best practice is to only have a single repository. so for example, you'd only have a brightpearljournalrepository and when you call ->fetchbyid it will return a brightpearl journal entity. this entity will have a property called rows which will be an array of brightpearlsalesorderrow entities. using this technique ensures that we only deal with entities in their complete form, which is the main concept of the entity pattern. it doesn't make sense to retrieve just part of an entity."
