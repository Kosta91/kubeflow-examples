case sql_varchar:
case sql_wchar:
case sql_wvarchar: ifdef nanodbc_use_unicode col.ctype_ = sql_c_wchar; else col.ctype_ = sql_c_char; endif col.clen_ = col.sqlsize_ + 1 sizeof nanodbc_sqlchar ; i don't know this for sure; i haven't tried it! i might though. if i do i'll let you know. the disadvantage here is that you're committing to one string type in your code at compile time. in theory, your current setup, combined with my pull request, lets you mix and match narrow and wide char strings in the same application, as you choose. _copied from original issue: lexicalunit/nanodbc/pull/18_"
