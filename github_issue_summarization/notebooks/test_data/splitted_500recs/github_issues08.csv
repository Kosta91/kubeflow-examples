from: janne.peltonen@nokia.com when an interface address and subnet is configured through the cli,
the fast path tries to sync the configuration to the os kernel
with an incorrect netmask. for example, ifconfig fp0 10.0.0.1/24 command in cli results in
fast path invoking ifconfig fp0 11.0.0.1 netmask 0.255.255.255 up since the netmask is invalid, my system seems to fall back to
mask lenght of 8 bits so that in kernel the interface gets the
address 11.0.0.1/8. the incorrect subnet in kernel config
gets then synced back to fast path through a netlink notification
so that also the fast path ends up having an incorrect netmask. the bug is caused by ofp_config_interface_up_v4 keeping
netmask in a local variable in the big endian byte order but
failing to convert it back to the native byte order before
calculating the arguments for ifconfig. ofp version: 2.0.0 bugzilla comment id: 212

2473004,"""https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/3729""",id's for ui automation tests on dynamic objects,"_from @kseeman on march 1, 2017 18:21_ here’s what i have for the github issue: i'm trying to create ui automation tests and i'm running into an issue with setting the automationtext attribute to a static value on an object such as a label or a button where the text is dynamic. by setting the automationtext to a unique value it makes it easier to create ui automation tests, but it causes an adverse side effect of forcing the talk back feature to speak the wrong value. if you set the value of a label dynamically based on the result of an api call, you obviously want talk back to read the value of the label. take this code for example: <label automationtext=”welcome message” text =”welcomemessage”></label> talk back will read “welcome message” out loud, opposed to whatever the variable “welcomemessage” is set to and is shown on the screen . to provide a better accessibility experience, ui automation is made more difficult. i'm new to ui automation for mobile apps but in previous projects for native applications each object was able to be given a specific id that is separate from what talk back uses. this allowed us to create unique ids for all the objects and made creating ui automation tests much simpler. in native apps, when an id was set and you used android's uiautomatorviewer to view the objects, the resource-id was set like: <packagename>:id/<id>. for example com.company.application:id/etfirstname. this allowed for tools like xamarin.uitests and appium to have visible ids' that are separate from what the talk back uses. is this something that can be added or changed to solve this issue? if not, what are some other approaches that i can do to handle situations like these? thank you. _copied from original issue: nativescript/nativescript-cli 2582_"
